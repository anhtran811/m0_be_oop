# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
*I was initially getting really nervous that I wasn't getting the proper output. I know that the lesson talked about how we should do our best and aren't expected to have mastery, but it still makes me nervous when I am not grasping concepts at the pace I feel like I should. These problems encouraged me to think logically and utilize the concepts I have learned during Mod0. I tend to try to solve problems based off memorization of previous problems/questions and I know this is not the proper way to go about things. When I took a second to really digest what the question was asking, I was able to complete the questions with some struggle, but it felt rewarding to figure it out*

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
*I do a good job staying focused when working on assignments, however, I need to do a better job taking breaks. I get pulled into my work and los track of time. It helped when I started setting a timer.*

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
*During Mod0, I have been trying to work on my assignments for 4-6 hours (with breaks - when I remember to take them) in order to train my mental endurance. I think that for Mod1, not only do I need to set a timer to take breaks, but to change positions at my sit/stand desk as well. I don't think I need external support from someone, just need to be more accountable by setting timers and sticking to scheduled breaks*
